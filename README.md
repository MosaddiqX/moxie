## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Moxie leverages Next.js 14 with the App Router for server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring scalability and performance. The architecture emphasizes reusable components and a clear separation of concerns.

### Key Components

- **Core Pages**:

  - **Home**: Showcases featured movies and carousels.
  - **Movie Detail**: Displays detailed movie info with a parallax header.
  - **Person Detail**: Profiles actors and directors with sticky scrolling.
  - **Movies**: Offers search and filtering capabilities.
  - **Collections**: Manages Watchlist, Favorites, and Recently Viewed.

- **Custom Hooks**:

  - `useLocalStorage`: Persists user preferences.
  - `useFavorites`: Handles favorite movies.
  - `useWatchlist`: Manages watchlist with import/export options.
  - `useRecentlyViewed`: Tracks viewing history.
  - `useRecommendations`: Generates personalized suggestions.
  - `useDebounce`: Optimizes search performance.

- **UI Components**:
  - `MovieCard`: Reusable card with hover effects.
  - `MovieCarousel`: Scrollable movie lists.
  - `HeroSection`: Animated featured movie showcase.
  - `MovieDetailHero`: Parallax movie header.
  - `PersonDetailHero`: Sticky actor/director profile.
  - `Navbar`: Responsive navigation with mobile menu.
  - `BrandLogo`: Theme-aware animated logo.

## ü§ñ Recommendation Algorithm

Moxie‚Äôs recommendation system personalizes movie suggestions based on user behavior. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Data Collection**:

   - Tracks Recently Viewed, Favorites, and Watchlist movies.

2. **Genre-Based Weighting**:

   - Assigns weights to genres:
     - Recently Viewed: 1x (with recency bias).
     - Favorites: 2x (strong preference).
     - Watchlist: 1.5x (interest indicator).

3. **Score Calculation**:

   - Computes cumulative genre scores and ranks them.

4. **Movie Selection**:

   - Fetches movies from the top 2 genres.
   - Excludes duplicates and previously interacted movies.
   - Sorts by popularity, limiting to 12 results.

5. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Uses interaction history directly if genre data is limited.
